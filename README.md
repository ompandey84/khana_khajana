# khana_khajana
A responsive website and QR Menu System for digital food ordering where users can browse menus, place orders, and make payments online. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL via XAMPP, the system ensures smooth, secure, and intuitive interactions.
It looks like your GitHub repository `khana_khajana` is a web application related to food ordering or a food app interface. Based on the file structure (HTML, CSS, JS, potentially Node.js, and views/public directories), it seems to be a frontend-heavy or full-stack project.

Here's a `README.md` file designed for your project. I've made some assumptions based on common "Khana Khazana" project types, so feel free to **customize** it with specifics about your project's unique features, technologies, and purpose.
